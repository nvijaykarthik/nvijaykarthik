## Kubernetes

Migrating from PCF to Kubernetes requires careful planning, especially for environment variables, secret management, networking, and container choices. Here’s what you need to consider:

### 1. **Secret Management**
   - PCF uses **CredHub**, while Kubernetes has **Secrets**.
   - Store secrets in **Kubernetes Secrets** (`kubectl create secret generic` or use Helm charts to inject them).
   - Use **external secret management tools** like:
     - **HashiCorp Vault** (popular for enterprise use)
     - **AWS Secrets Manager / Azure Key Vault** (if using cloud)
     - **Sealed Secrets** (encrypt secrets before storing in Git)
   - Ensure **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)** is applied to limit access.

### 2. **Environment Variables**
   - PCF uses **VCAP_SERVICES** for service binding.
   - In Kubernetes:
     - Use **ConfigMaps** for non-sensitive environment variables.
     - Use **Secrets** for sensitive information (passwords, API keys).
     - Modify microservices to read environment variables in a more Kubernetes-friendly way.

### 3. **Networking Setup**
   - PCF provides built-in routing. In Kubernetes:
     - Use **Ingress controllers** (NGINX, Traefik) for external access.
     - Use **ClusterIP services** for internal service communication.
     - Use **NetworkPolicies** to control traffic between pods.

### 4. **Container Choices**
   - PCF supports buildpacks, Kubernetes works best with **OCI-compliant Docker containers**.
   - Choose between:
     - **Docker**: Standard approach, gives full control.
     - **Buildpacks (Paketo)**: If you want a similar experience to PCF.
     - **Distroless or Alpine**: Lightweight, more secure base images.

### 5. **Other Considerations**
   - **Service Discovery:** Use Kubernetes service discovery instead of PCF’s internal mechanism.
   - **Scaling:** Use Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) instead of PCF’s scaling.
   - **Logging & Monitoring:** PCF has Loggregator; use **Prometheus, Grafana, ELK, or Loki** in Kubernetes.
   - **Persistent Storage:** If needed, use PersistentVolumes and PersistentVolumeClaims.

Would you like any specific guidance on setting up your Kubernetes cluster? 🚀
Yes, IP range exhaustion can be a real issue in **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**, especially when you enable **auto-scaling** and have many nodes and pods dynamically created.  

### **Why is IP Range Exhaustion a Concern?**
- By default, AKS assigns **IP addresses from the Virtual Network (VNet)**.
- As new pods and nodes scale up, they consume more **IPs from the subnet**.
- If the subnet runs out of IPs, **new pods/nodes won’t be scheduled**.
- The problem becomes worse if you have **large-scale deployments**.

---

## **Solution: Use an Overlay Network (Azure CNI Overlay)**
To avoid IP exhaustion, you can use **Azure CNI Overlay**, which separates pod IP addressing from the VNet. Instead of using **real VNet IPs**, pods get IPs from an **internal overlay network**.

### **Key Benefits of Overlay Network**
✅ **Reduces IP consumption** → Pods get IPs from an internal pool instead of the main VNet.  
✅ **More scalable** → Supports up to **250 pods per node** without subnet exhaustion.  
✅ **Works with auto-scaling** → Allows dynamic scaling without exhausting IPs.  

---

## **How to Configure Azure CNI Overlay in AKS**
You need to create an AKS cluster with **Azure CNI Overlay** enabled.

### **1️⃣ Create an AKS Cluster with Overlay Network**
```sh
az aks create \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --name myAKSCluster \
  --network-plugin azure \
  --network-plugin-mode overlay \
  --enable-managed-identity \
  --node-count 3 \
  --enable-cluster-autoscaler \
  --min-count 3 \
  --max-count 10
```
- `--network-plugin azure`: Enables **Azure CNI**.
- `--network-plugin-mode overlay`: Enables **overlay networking**.
- `--enable-cluster-autoscaler`: Ensures AKS scales up/down dynamically.

### **2️⃣ Check the Network Configuration**
To verify that overlay networking is enabled:
```sh
kubectl get nodes -o wide
kubectl get pods -A -o wide
```
You should see **internal pod IPs** that are different from your VNet subnet.

### **3️⃣ Migrate an Existing AKS Cluster (Optional)**
If you already have an AKS cluster and want to **switch to overlay networking**, follow these steps:

#### **Backup Your Workloads**
```sh
kubectl get all --all-namespaces -o yaml > backup.yaml
```

#### **Detach & Delete the Existing AKS Cluster**
```sh
az aks delete --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --yes
```

#### **Recreate the AKS Cluster with Overlay Networking**
```sh
az aks create \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --name myAKSCluster \
  --network-plugin azure \
  --network-plugin-mode overlay \
  --node-count 3
```

---

## **Considerations When Using Overlay Networking**
1. **DNS Resolution**: Since pod IPs are now internal, ensure DNS resolution is configured properly.  
2. **Inter-Service Communication**: Use **Kubernetes Services** (`ClusterIP`, `NodePort`, `LoadBalancer`) to route traffic correctly.  
3. **Egress Traffic**: Pods may need a **NAT Gateway** or Azure Firewall to access external services.  
4. **Ingress Traffic**: Use **Azure Load Balancer or NGINX Ingress** for external teams to access your APIs.  

---

## **Summary**
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Default AKS Networking** | Uses VNet IPs, but can exhaust IPs if auto-scaling |
| **Azure CNI Overlay** ✅ | Uses internal IPs for pods, prevents subnet exhaustion, best for large-scale clusters |
| **How to Enable?** | `--network-plugin azure --network-plugin-mode overlay` |
| **Ingress Consideration** | Use **Ingress Controller** or **Load Balancer** |
| **Egress Consideration** | Use **NAT Gateway** for external API calls |

---

Would you like help setting up **Ingress/Egress rules** with Azure CNI Overlay? 🚀

If you're running **Kubernetes on your own VMs**, you'll need to manually configure **egress rules** to allow your pods to connect to the database. Here's how you can do it based on different network setups.

---

## **1️⃣ How Does Egress Work in a Self-Managed Kubernetes Cluster?**
- By default, Kubernetes **does not block egress traffic** (unless NetworkPolicies are applied).  
- Your **pods need access to the database** via its **private IP (VNet)** or **public IP (Internet)**.  
- If your Kubernetes cluster is running **on-premise or in a cloud VMs setup**, egress must be properly **routed**.  

---

## **2️⃣ Case 1: Database is in the Same VNet (Recommended)**
If your database is in the **same private network (VNet)** as Kubernetes, you can:
✅ **Use the database’s private IP address**  
✅ **Ensure VMs have correct routing to the database subnet**  

### **Example: Configure NetworkPolicy to Allow Egress to Database**
If using **Calico, Cilium, or another CNI that supports NetworkPolicies**, you can **explicitly allow traffic to the database**:
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-db-egress
spec:
  podSelector: {}  # Apply to all pods
  policyTypes:
    - Egress
  egress:
    - to:
        - ipBlock:
            cidr: 10.10.1.0/24  # Database subnet range
      ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 5432  # Example: PostgreSQL
```
🔹 **What this does?**  
- Allows **all pods** to talk to **any DB instance in `10.10.1.0/24`** on **port 5432** (PostgreSQL).  
- Adjust the IP range & port based on **your database setup**.

---

## **3️⃣ Case 2: Database is External (Public Cloud)**
If your database is hosted **outside your VMs (e.g., AWS RDS, Azure SQL, etc.)**, you need to:
✅ **Allow outbound traffic from Kubernetes nodes**  
✅ **Ensure the firewall allows access from Kubernetes nodes**  
✅ **Use a NAT Gateway or specific egress rules to route traffic**  

### **Option 1: Allow Specific Egress to Cloud Database**
If your database has a **public IP (e.g., AWS RDS, Azure SQL, GCP Cloud SQL)**, **restrict egress to only allow traffic to that specific IP**.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-external-db
spec:
  podSelector: {}  # Apply to all pods
  policyTypes:
    - Egress
  egress:
    - to:
        - ipBlock:
            cidr: 52.15.34.123/32  # Public IP of the database
      ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 3306  # Example: MySQL
```
🔹 **What this does?**  
- Allows all pods to connect **only to the database at `52.15.34.123`**.  
- **Blocks egress** to any other external public IPs (good for security).  

---

## **4️⃣ Case 3: Using a NAT Gateway or Proxy for Egress**
If your cluster **does not have direct internet access**, you might need:
✅ **A NAT gateway** (to route outbound traffic).  
✅ **A proxy server** (if your company restricts external access).  

### **Example: Routing Egress Through a NAT Gateway**
If your Kubernetes cluster sits in a **private network**, you can **route egress traffic through a NAT gateway**.

#### **Steps:**
1️⃣ Deploy a **NAT gateway** (or configure an existing one).  
2️⃣ Update your **Kubernetes node’s route table** to send traffic to the **NAT gateway’s IP**.  
3️⃣ Verify that pods can reach the **database’s public/private IP**.  

---

## **Summary: Which Approach to Choose?**
| **Scenario** | **Solution** |
|-------------|-------------|
| DB is in the same private network (VNet/Subnet) | Allow **private IP-based egress** using **NetworkPolicy** |
| DB is a public cloud service (AWS RDS, Azure SQL) | Allow **specific public IP egress** |
| Cluster has **no direct internet access** | Use a **NAT gateway** to route traffic |
| Security policies require **strict egress control** | Use **NetworkPolicies** to allow only **specific destinations** |

---

### **Next Steps**
Would you like help configuring **NAT Gateway**, a **Proxy Setup**, or a **Firewall Rule for your database**? 🚀
Sure! Below is a **complete Kubernetes YAML configuration** to deploy a service with the following features:  

✅ **3 replicas (instances)** of your service.  
✅ **Secrets & environment variables** stored securely.  
✅ **Ingress** for external API access.  
✅ **Egress** to a database and an external API.  
✅ **Network policies** for security.  

---

### **📌 1. Secrets & ConfigMap (For Credentials & Environment Variables)**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-app-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  DB_USERNAME: cG9zdGdyZXM=  # Base64 encoded (postgres)
  DB_PASSWORD: c2VjdXJlMTIz  # Base64 encoded (secure123)

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: my-app-config
data:
  DATABASE_URL: "jdbc:postgresql://10.10.1.100:5432/mydb"
  EXTERNAL_API_URL: "https://api.external.com"
```
🔹 **Why?**  
- **Secrets** store sensitive data (**base64-encoded**) like DB credentials.  
- **ConfigMap** stores non-sensitive env variables.

---

### **📌 2. Deployment (3 Replicas, Uses Secrets & ConfigMap)**
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: my-app
          image: my-app-image:v1
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
          env:
            - name: DB_USERNAME
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: my-app-secret
                  key: DB_USERNAME
            - name: DB_PASSWORD
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: my-app-secret
                  key: DB_PASSWORD
            - name: DATABASE_URL
              valueFrom:
                configMapKeyRef:
                  name: my-app-config
                  key: DATABASE_URL
            - name: EXTERNAL_API_URL
              valueFrom:
                configMapKeyRef:
                  name: my-app-config
                  key: EXTERNAL_API_URL
```
🔹 **Why?**  
- **3 replicas** ensure high availability.  
- **Uses secrets & ConfigMap** for DB & API configuration.

---

### **📌 3. Service (ClusterIP)**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-app-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
  type: ClusterIP  # Internal access only
```
🔹 **Why?**  
- **ClusterIP** exposes the service only within the cluster.

---

### **📌 4. Ingress (Allow API Access for Other Teams)**
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: my-app-ingress
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
spec:
  rules:
  - host: my-api.example.com  # Replace with your domain
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: my-app-service
            port:
              number: 80
```
🔹 **Why?**  
- This **exposes the API externally** via `my-api.example.com`.

---

### **📌 5. NetworkPolicy (Secure DB & API Communication)**
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: restrict-egress
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  policyTypes:
    - Egress
  egress:
    - to:
        - ipBlock:
            cidr: 10.10.1.100/32  # DB Private IP
      ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 5432  # PostgreSQL
    - to:
        - ipBlock:
            cidr: 52.15.34.123/32  # External API Public IP
      ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 443  # HTTPS
```
🔹 **Why?**  
- **Restricts egress traffic** to only the **DB & external API**.  
- **Prevents accidental data exfiltration**.

Would you like to customize this for a specific database (e.g., MySQL, MongoDB)?
To test your **Kubernetes setup locally**, you can use **Kind (Kubernetes in Docker)** or **Minikube**. Below is a complete guide to set up and test your YAML configuration.

---

## **1️⃣ Install Kubernetes Locally**
You need:
✅ **kubectl** (Kubernetes CLI)  
✅ **Kind** or **Minikube**  

### **Option 1: Using Kind (Recommended)**
Install **Kind**:
```sh
curl -Lo ./kind https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/dl/latest/kind-linux-amd64
chmod +x ./kind
sudo mv ./kind /usr/local/bin/kind
```
Create a Kubernetes cluster:
```sh
kind create cluster --name my-local-cluster
```

### **Option 2: Using Minikube**
Install **Minikube**:
```sh
curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64
chmod +x minikube-linux-amd64
sudo mv minikube-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/minikube
```
Start a cluster:
```sh
minikube start
```

---

## **2️⃣ Apply the Configuration**
Once your local Kubernetes cluster is running, apply the **YAML configuration**.

```sh
kubectl apply -f secrets-configmap.yaml
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f service.yaml
kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml
kubectl apply -f network-policy.yaml
```

---

## **3️⃣ Verify Everything is Running**
### **Check Pods**
```sh
kubectl get pods
```
If everything is working, you should see 3 running pods:
```
NAME                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
my-app-74fd98d88b-x7k4r       1/1     Running   0          30s
my-app-74fd98d88b-p9q7d       1/1     Running   0          30s
my-app-74fd98d88b-w2j1m       1/1     Running   0          30s
```

### **Check Services**
```sh
kubectl get svc
```
You should see:
```
NAME             TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       PORT(S)   AGE
my-app-service   ClusterIP   10.96.108.45     80/TCP    2m
```

### **Check Ingress (If Using Minikube)**
If using Minikube, enable the ingress controller:
```sh
minikube addons enable ingress
```
Then check the ingress:
```sh
kubectl get ingress
```
Expected output:
```
NAME             HOSTS                 ADDRESS        PORTS   AGE
my-app-ingress   my-api.example.com    192.168.49.2   80      3m
```

---

## **4️⃣ Test Connectivity**
### **Test Ingress (External API Access)**
If using Minikube, get the IP:
```sh
minikube ip
```
Then, add an entry to your `/etc/hosts`:
```
192.168.49.2   my-api.example.com
```
Now test the API:
```sh
curl http://my-api.example.com
```

### **Test Database Connection (Egress)**
To check if your service can reach the database, exec into a pod:
```sh
kubectl exec -it $(kubectl get pods -l app=my-app -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') -- /bin/sh
```
Then try connecting to the DB:
```sh
nc -zv 10.10.1.100 5432
```
If successful, you’ll see:
```
Connection to 10.10.1.100 5432 port [tcp/postgres] succeeded!
```

## Apache Kafka Overview
Apache Kafka is an open-source **distributed event streaming platform** designed for **high-throughput, fault-tolerant, and scalable** messaging. It is widely used for **real-time data streaming, event-driven architectures, and distributed data processing**.

---

### **Key Components of Kafka**  
1. **Producer**  
   - Sends messages (events) to Kafka topics.  
   - Can publish messages asynchronously with low latency.  

2. **Broker**  
   - A Kafka cluster consists of multiple brokers.  
   - Each broker stores and serves messages from topics.  

3. **Topic**  
   - A logical category where messages are published.  
   - Can be partitioned for parallel processing and scalability.  

4. **Partition**  
   - Each topic is divided into partitions for scalability.  
   - Messages in a partition are stored in an **append-only log**.  

5. **Consumer**  
   - Reads messages from Kafka topics.  
   - Consumers can be grouped into **consumer groups** for parallel processing.  

6. **Zookeeper** *(optional in newer versions, replaced by KRaft)*  
   - Manages cluster metadata, leader election, and configurations.  

---

### **Why Use Kafka?**  

1. **High Throughput & Scalability**  
   - Kafka handles millions of messages per second by partitioning topics.  

2. **Fault Tolerance**  
   - Messages are replicated across multiple brokers to ensure availability.  

3. **Durability**  
   - Messages are stored on disk, ensuring they are not lost.  

4. **Decoupling of Services**  
   - Kafka allows microservices and applications to communicate asynchronously.  

5. **Real-Time Processing**  
   - Works with **Kafka Streams** and **Apache Flink** for real-time analytics.  

6. **Event-Driven Architecture**  
   - Supports event sourcing and event-driven microservices.  

---

### **Common Use Cases of Kafka**  

1. **Log Aggregation**  
   - Collects logs from multiple sources for analysis.  

2. **Real-Time Analytics**  
   - Used with **Apache Spark, Flink, or ELK stack** for monitoring and analytics.  

3. **Message Queue Replacement**  
   - Can replace traditional messaging systems like RabbitMQ and ActiveMQ.  

4. **Event Sourcing**  
   - Captures state changes in a system as a sequence of events.  

5. **Streaming Data Pipelines**  
   - Moves data between different systems (e.g., databases, cloud storage).  

6. **IoT & Telemetry Data**  
   - Processes sensor data, tracking data, and IoT event streams.  

---

### **Kafka vs. Traditional Messaging Queues**  

| Feature         | Kafka                      | RabbitMQ / ActiveMQ |
|----------------|---------------------------|---------------------|
| **Message Retention** | Retains messages for a configured time | Deletes after consumption |
| **Scalability** | Horizontally scalable via partitions | Limited scalability |
| **Ordering** | Maintains order within a partition | No strict ordering |
| **Use Case** | Streaming, real-time processing | Request-response messaging |

---

### **Kafka in Your Use Case**  
Since you are working with **Spring AI, LangChain, and event-driven systems**, Kafka can be useful for:  
✅ **Real-time email alert processing** (streaming critical alerts)  
✅ **Event-driven architecture for AI-based analysis**  
✅ **SFTP file processing pipeline** (for tracking and ensuring files are processed by only one instance)  

Would you like help setting up Kafka with **Spring Boot** or integrating it into your projects? 🚀

### **What is a Partition in Kafka?**  
A **partition** is a **subdivision** of a **Kafka topic**, allowing data to be distributed across multiple brokers. Each partition is an **ordered, immutable sequence of messages**, and messages in a partition are identified by an **offset** (a unique identifier).  

📌 **Key Properties of Partitions:**  
1. **Data Distribution:** A topic can have multiple partitions spread across different Kafka brokers.  
2. **Scalability:** Parallel processing is possible because multiple consumers can read from different partitions.  
3. **Ordering Guarantee:** Messages within a single partition are **always in order** (FIFO), but not across partitions.  

---

### **Why Are Partitions Useful?**  

#### **1️⃣ Parallelism & Scalability**  
- Since a topic is divided into multiple partitions, Kafka can **scale horizontally** by distributing partitions across multiple brokers.  
- Multiple **consumers in a consumer group** can read from different partitions in parallel.  

#### **2️⃣ High Throughput**  
- Kafka can process a large number of messages per second because multiple partitions allow parallel processing.  
- Producers can write to different partitions **simultaneously**, avoiding bottlenecks.  

#### **3️⃣ Fault Tolerance & Replication**  
- Each partition can have **replicas** (backup copies) on other brokers.  
- If a broker fails, Kafka can **elect a new leader partition** to continue processing.  

#### **4️⃣ Load Balancing for Consumers**  
- Kafka automatically assigns partitions to consumers in a **consumer group**, ensuring even workload distribution.  

---

### **How Partitions Work in Kafka**  

📌 **Example Scenario:**  
🔹 Suppose you have a **Topic: "order-events"** with **3 partitions**.  

| Partition | Messages (FIFO Order) |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Partition-0 | Order1 → Order4 → Order7 |
| Partition-1 | Order2 → Order5 → Order8 |
| Partition-2 | Order3 → Order6 → Order9 |

- When a producer sends a message, Kafka assigns it to a partition using:  
  - **Round-robin (default, if no key is provided)**  
  - **Partition Key (messages with the same key go to the same partition for ordering)**  

---

### **How Kafka Assigns Messages to Partitions?**  

1️⃣ **Round-Robin (Default, No Key)**  
   - Messages are evenly distributed across all partitions.  
   - Ensures load balancing but does not guarantee ordering across partitions.  

2️⃣ **Key-Based Partitioning (Hashing Key)**  
   - If a **message has a key**, Kafka uses a **hash function** to determine the partition.  
   - Ensures that messages with the same key always go to the **same partition** (useful for maintaining order).  

🔹 **Example:**  
- A producer sends messages with **Customer ID** as the key.  
- All orders from **Customer 123** always go to the **same partition**, ensuring order is maintained for that customer.  

---

### **Consumer Groups and Partition Assignment**  

- Consumers in a **Consumer Group** subscribe to a topic.  
- Kafka **distributes partitions** among consumers in the group.  
- Each **partition is consumed by only one consumer** in a group at a time.  
- If a consumer fails, Kafka **rebalances** and reassigns partitions.  

📌 **Example:**  
**Topic: "user-activity" with 3 partitions and 2 consumers**  

| Partition | Consumer |
|-----------|---------|
| Partition-0 | Consumer-1 |
| Partition-1 | Consumer-2 |
| Partition-2 | Consumer-1 |

- If **Consumer-1 fails**, Kafka reassigns **Partition-0 & Partition-2** to **Consumer-2**.  

---

### **Partitioning Strategy for Applications**  

1️⃣ **Choosing the Right Number of Partitions**  
   - More partitions **increase parallelism** but require **more resources**.  
   - Rule of thumb:  
     - Number of **partitions >= number of consumers** in a consumer group.  
     - Keep in mind the **broker capacity** and **network bandwidth**.  

2️⃣ **Ensuring Order When Needed**  
   - If strict **ordering is required**, use **key-based partitioning**.  
   - Example: **"Bank Transactions" per account should be in the correct order.**  

3️⃣ **Optimizing Consumer Load**  
   - Evenly distribute partitions among **consumers** to avoid **hotspots** (one consumer overloaded).  

---

### **Use Case Examples**  

✅ **Real-Time Email Alert Analysis (Your Use Case)**  
- **Partition Key:** Customer ID or Severity Level (Critical, High, Low)  
- Ensures **critical alerts** are processed in order while scaling other categories.  

✅ **SFTP File Processing**  
- **Partition Key:** File Name or Folder Name  
- Ensures **each file is processed in order** by the same consumer.  

✅ **Order Processing in E-Commerce**  
- **Partition Key:** Customer ID  
- Ensures all orders from a **specific customer** go to the same partition.  

---

### **Final Takeaways**  

✔ **Kafka partitions enable parallelism, scalability, and fault tolerance.**  
✔ **Messages within a partition are always ordered, but not across partitions.**  
✔ **Choosing the right number of partitions and keys affects performance.**  
✔ **Partitions help distribute load efficiently among consumers in a group.**  

Would you like help designing an **optimal partitioning strategy** for your Kafka use case? 🚀

### **Handling Traffic in a Multi-Instance Kafka Consumer Application**  

If you have **multiple instances of an application consuming from the same Kafka topic**, you need a strategy to ensure **efficient load balancing, scalability, and fault tolerance**.  

Kafka handles this automatically using **Consumer Groups**, **Partitioning**, and **Rebalancing**.  

---

## **1️⃣ Use Consumer Groups for Load Balancing**  

A **Consumer Group** is a set of consumer instances that work together to consume messages from a topic.  

✅ **Kafka ensures that each partition is consumed by only one consumer in a group at a time.**  
✅ **Consumers within a group share the load dynamically.**  

📌 **Example:**  
- **Topic:** `email-alerts` (3 partitions)  
- **Consumers (instances):** `Consumer-1, Consumer-2, Consumer-3`  
- **Kafka will distribute the partitions among them:**  

| Partition | Assigned Consumer |
|-----------|------------------|
| Partition-0 | Consumer-1 |
| Partition-1 | Consumer-2 |
| Partition-2 | Consumer-3 |

🛠 **Steps to implement in Spring Boot:**  
- Assign all consumer instances to the **same Consumer Group ID**  
- Kafka will automatically **rebalance** partitions among consumers  

```properties
spring.kafka.consumer.group-id=email-alert-group
```

### **Scaling Up or Down**  
✅ **If a new instance (Consumer-4) starts**, Kafka **rebalances partitions**  
✅ **If an instance fails, Kafka reassigns partitions to healthy consumers**  

---

## **2️⃣ Optimize Partition Count for Scalability**  

💡 **Rule of thumb:**  
- **Number of partitions ≥ Number of consumer instances**  
- If you have **5 instances**, ensure the topic has at least **5 partitions**  
- More partitions allow **higher parallelism** but require more resources  

```shell
# Create a topic with 5 partitions
kafka-topics.sh --create --topic email-alerts --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --partitions 5 --replication-factor 2
```

---

## **3️⃣ Use Sticky Partitioning for Ordered Processing**  

By default, Kafka **assigns messages randomly (round-robin)**, but if **ordering is important**, use **key-based partitioning**.  

📌 **Example:**  
- For **email alerts**, use **Customer ID** as the key  
- All messages from the same customer go to the same partition, ensuring order  

🛠 **Spring Boot Kafka Producer Example (Partition Keying):**  

```java
public void sendAlert(String customerId, String alertMessage) {
    kafkaTemplate.send("email-alerts", customerId, alertMessage);
}
```

---

## **4️⃣ Tune Consumer Configurations for High Traffic**  

For **high-throughput applications**, adjust the following **Kafka Consumer settings**:  

### **🔹 Increase Fetch Size for Bulk Processing**
More messages per request = better performance  
```properties
spring.kafka.consumer.fetch-min-bytes=50000  # Min batch size
spring.kafka.consumer.fetch-max-wait=500  # Max wait time (ms) before fetching messages
```

### **🔹 Enable Auto-Commit for Offset Management**
Kafka automatically commits processed messages  
```properties
spring.kafka.consumer.enable-auto-commit=true
spring.kafka.consumer.auto-commit-interval=1000  # Commit offset every second
```

### **🔹 Use Manual Offset Commit for Precise Control**
If processing must be **guaranteed before committing**  
```java
@KafkaListener(topics = "email-alerts", groupId = "email-alert-group")
public void processMessage(String message, Acknowledgment acknowledgment) {
    try {
        // Process the message
        System.out.println("Processing: " + message);
        acknowledgment.acknowledge(); // Manually commit offset
    } catch (Exception e) {
        // Handle failure (do not commit offset)
    }
}
```

---

## **5️⃣ Implement Retry & Dead Letter Handling for Failures**  

If a message **fails to process**, Kafka will retry it indefinitely **unless handled properly**.  

🔹 **Solution:** Use a **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)** to store failed messages  

🛠 **Spring Boot DLQ Configuration:**  
```properties
spring.kafka.consumer.properties.enable.idempotence=true
spring.kafka.listener.ack-mode=manual
```

In case of failure, forward bad messages to a **"dead-letter-topic"** for investigation.

---

## **🚀 Final Strategy to Handle Kafka Traffic**  

✅ **Use Consumer Groups** → Automatic load balancing  
✅ **Increase Partitions** → More parallel processing  
✅ **Use Key-Based Partitioning** → Maintain ordering where needed  
✅ **Tune Consumer Configurations** → Optimize performance  
✅ **Implement DLQ & Retry Mechanism** → Handle failures gracefully  

---

### **Would you like help setting up a Spring Boot Kafka consumer with these optimizations?** 🚀

Yes, that's correct! If you have **different consumer groups**, **each group gets its own copy** of the message.  

### **How It Works:**  

- A **Kafka topic** stores messages.  
- **Consumers within the same group** share partitions (only **one** consumer in a group reads a message).  
- **Consumers in different groups each get a full copy** of the message.  

---

### **Example: Single Consumer Group (Load Balancing Only)**
**Scenario:**  
- **Topic:** `email-alerts` (3 partitions)  
- **Consumer Group:** `alert-processing-group`  
- **3 Consumers (C1, C2, C3) in the same group**  

| Partition | Assigned Consumer |
|-----------|------------------|
| Partition-0 | C1 |
| Partition-1 | C2 |
| Partition-2 | C3 |

✅ **Each message is consumed only once** by one of the consumers.  
✅ **Good for high-throughput processing (load balancing).**  

---

### **Example: Multiple Consumer Groups (Message Duplication)**
**Scenario:**  
- **Topic:** `email-alerts` (3 partitions)  
- **2 Consumer Groups:**  
  1. `alert-processing-group` (Processes alerts)  
  2. `alert-logging-group` (Stores alerts for auditing)  

Each group **gets an independent copy** of the messages.  

| Partition | Group: alert-processing-group | Group: alert-logging-group |
|-----------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|
| Partition-0 | C1 (Processing) | C4 (Logging) |
| Partition-1 | C2 (Processing) | C5 (Logging) |
| Partition-2 | C3 (Processing) | C6 (Logging) |

✅ **Each group gets its own copy of the messages.**  
✅ **Useful when multiple applications need the same data (e.g., real-time processing + auditing/logging).**  

---

### **Key Takeaways**  
✔ **Same consumer group** → Messages are **shared** (load balancing).  
✔ **Different consumer groups** → Messages are **duplicated** (each group gets a full copy).  
✔ **Use multiple consumer groups when multiple independent applications need the same data.**

### **Setting Up Kafka for Enterprise-Grade High Availability & Data Replication in Azure**  

To deploy **Apache Kafka on Azure** for high availability and data replication, consider the following key areas:  

---

## **1️⃣ Choose the Right Deployment Model**  
You have two main options:  

### **✅ Option 1: Managed Kafka (Azure Event Hubs for Kafka API)**
🔹 **Pros:**  
✔ Fully managed, auto-scalable  
✔ Built-in **geo-replication**  
✔ No need for Zookeeper management  
✔ Azure **integrations (Log Analytics, Monitoring, Security)**  

🔹 **Cons:**  
❌ Limited Kafka features (e.g., no direct broker access)  
❌ Expensive at high scale  

📌 **Recommended for:**  
- If you want **fully managed Kafka** with minimal maintenance.  
- Use **Azure Event Hubs Kafka API** instead of managing your own cluster.  

---

### **✅ Option 2: Self-Managed Kafka on Azure (VMs / Kubernetes / AKS)**
🔹 **Pros:**  
✔ Full control over Kafka configuration  
✔ Can be fine-tuned for **high throughput & replication**  
✔ Lower cost at high scale  

🔹 **Cons:**  
❌ Requires **manual setup, monitoring, and scaling**  
❌ Zookeeper must be managed separately  

📌 **Recommended for:**  
- If you need **custom Kafka tuning** (e.g., large-scale enterprise workloads).  
- Use **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)** or **Azure Virtual Machines (VMs)** with Terraform/Ansible for automation.  

---

## **2️⃣ High Availability Setup (Multi-Zone, Multi-Region)**
To ensure **high availability**, you need **Kafka replication** and **multi-zone deployment**.  

### **🔹 Key Configurations**
| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `replication.factor=3` | Each partition has **3 copies** for redundancy |
| `min.insync.replicas=2` | Ensures a message is committed only if **2 replicas are in sync** |
| `unclean.leader.election.enable=false` | Prevents data loss by avoiding election of out-of-sync replicas |
| `broker.rack` | Assigns brokers to **different Azure zones** to ensure failure resilience |

### **🛠️ Multi-Zone Deployment in Azure**
- Deploy Kafka brokers across **at least 3 Azure Availability Zones** (AZs).  
- Example: If using **Azure Virtual Machines**, deploy brokers as follows:  

| Broker | Zone | Region |
|--------|------|--------|
| Broker-1 | East-US-1a | East-US |
| Broker-2 | East-US-1b | East-US |
| Broker-3 | East-US-1c | East-US |

🔹 **Azure Services for HA**  
✔ Use **Azure Load Balancer** for distributing traffic  
✔ Use **Azure Managed Disks (Premium SSDs)** for storage durability  
✔ Deploy **Zookeeper in HA mode** (minimum **3 instances**)  

---

## **3️⃣ Data Replication & Disaster Recovery**
For **geo-redundancy**, deploy Kafka across **multiple Azure regions**.  

### **🔹 Multi-Region Replication**
- **Use MirrorMaker 2.0** for replicating topics between clusters in different Azure regions.  
- Example:  
  - **Primary Kafka Cluster:** `East US`  
  - **Backup Kafka Cluster:** `West US`  
  - MirrorMaker replicates data from East to West.  

📌 **MirrorMaker 2.0 Configuration for Cross-Region Replication**
```properties
source.bootstrap.servers=eastus-kafka.azure.com:9092
target.bootstrap.servers=westus-kafka.azure.com:9092
topics=critical-alerts,transactions
replication.factor=3
```

🔹 **Azure Services for DR**  
✔ **Azure Site Recovery (ASR)** for VM-based deployments  
✔ **Azure Blob Storage** for backup of Kafka logs  

---

## **4️⃣ Security & Authentication (Enterprise-Grade)**  
🔹 **Use Azure Active Directory (AAD) for Authentication**  
- Kafka can integrate with **Azure AD-based RBAC** for access control.  

🔹 **Enable SSL Encryption**  
```properties
ssl.keystore.location=/etc/kafka/keystore.jks
ssl.keystore.password=mypassword
ssl.enabled.protocols=TLSv1.2,TLSv1.3
```

🔹 **Enable Authorization with ACLs**  
```shell
kafka-acls --add --allow-principal "User:app1" --operation Read --topic critical-alerts
```

🔹 **Use Private Networking (VNet & Private Link)**  
- Deploy Kafka **inside an Azure VNet** and restrict public access.  
- Use **Azure Private Link** for secure connectivity between Kafka clients & brokers.  

---

## **5️⃣ Monitoring & Logging**
🔹 **Use Prometheus + Grafana for Metrics**  
- Set up **Kafka Exporter** for Prometheus monitoring.  
- Create Grafana dashboards for **latency, consumer lag, broker health**.  

🔹 **Use Azure Monitor + Log Analytics**  
- Send Kafka logs to **Azure Log Analytics** for centralized monitoring.  
- Set up alerts on **high consumer lag, broker failures, or low disk space**.  

---

## **6️⃣ Performance Tuning for High Throughput**
🔹 **Kafka Broker Optimization**
| Parameter | Recommended Setting |
|-----------|----------------------|
| `num.network.threads=8` | More threads for handling connections |
| `num.io.threads=16` | More threads for I/O operations |
| `log.segment.bytes=1GB` | Larger log segment size for reduced disk I/O |
| `message.max.bytes=10MB` | Allows larger messages |
| `compression.type=snappy` | Faster compression for better throughput |

🔹 **Consumer Tuning**
```properties
fetch.min.bytes=1048576   # Batch size: 1MB
max.poll.records=500       # Read 500 records per poll
enable.auto.commit=false   # Manual offset commits for control
```

🔹 **Producer Tuning**
```properties
acks=all                   # Strong durability guarantee
batch.size=65536           # Bigger batch size for efficiency
linger.ms=5                # Small delay to improve batching
compression.type=snappy    # Optimized compression
```

## Entra

To configure security policies for your microservices on Azure, you can use a combination of Microsoft Entra ID, Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), and Azure API Management (APIM). Here's how:

### **1. Kubernetes Access Control**
Since you're hosting microservices on Kubernetes in Azure, you can use **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)** with **Entra ID integration** for authentication and **RBAC** for access control.

- **Enforce RBAC for AKS**  
  - Grant **cluster admin** roles to only a few team members for deploying and restarting services.
  - Assign **read-only access** (such as "Azure Kubernetes Service Viewer") to other team members.
  - Use **Entra ID authentication** to avoid using Kubernetes service accounts.

- **Steps:**
  - Integrate AKS with Entra ID.
  - Define Azure RBAC roles using `az role assignment` or through the portal.
  - Apply Kubernetes-native RBAC policies (e.g., RoleBindings & ClusterRoleBindings).

### **2. Secure API Access**
Your microservices' APIs can be protected using **Azure API Management (APIM)** and **Entra ID-based authentication**.

- **Enforce API Access Control**
  - Use **APIM OAuth2/OpenID Connect authentication** with Entra ID.
  - Define policies in APIM to allow specific teams to access specific APIs.
  - Use **Managed Identities** to secure backend services.
  - Implement **rate limiting, quotas, and IP filtering** for external teams.

- **Steps:**
  - Register your APIs in Entra ID.
  - Configure APIM to enforce authentication.
  - Assign users/groups access using Entra ID and API Management policies.

### **3. Conditional Access & Monitoring**
- Use **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** to monitor and enforce security policies.
- Configure **Conditional Access policies** in Entra ID to restrict access based on device, location, and risk level.
- Use **Azure Monitor and Log Analytics** to track API access and Kubernetes activities.

Would you like detailed steps or a Terraform/Bicep script to automate this setup?

For securing API access from your UI, you can use **Microsoft Entra ID authentication with OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect (OIDC)**. Here’s how you can set it up:

### **1. Secure API Access for Users**
- **Use Entra ID for authentication:**  
  - Register your UI (frontend) and API (backend) as separate applications in **Microsoft Entra ID**.
  - Assign **user roles** (e.g., “User”, “Admin”) in Entra ID.

- **Implement OAuth2.0 Flow (Authorization Code Flow)**  
  - When users log in to the UI, they receive an **access token** from Entra ID.
  - The UI passes this **access token** when calling the API.
  - The API validates the token before allowing access.

### **2. Enforce Authorization in API**
- Use **Microsoft Identity Platform** (MSAL) in your frontend to authenticate users.
- In the API:
  - Validate the **JWT access token** in API requests.
  - Restrict access based on **user roles and groups**.

### **3. Define API Access Policies**
- Configure **API Management (APIM)** to enforce access control.
- Use **Conditional Access** to allow API access only from specific devices or locations.
- Implement **role-based access (RBAC)** in your API.

### **4. Example Setup**
- **Frontend (React/Angular)**
  - Authenticate users with MSAL.js.
  - Fetch and attach access tokens to API calls.
- **Backend (Spring Boot/.NET/etc.)**
  - Validate JWT tokens using Microsoft Entra.
  - Implement role-based access control (RBAC).

Would you like a sample implementation in your tech stack?

Below is a **sample configuration** covering:  

1. **Kubernetes Access Control** using **Azure RBAC & Kubernetes RBAC**  
2. **API Management (APIM) for Team Access**  
3. **OIDC-based API Security for Users** (with Role-based Access)  

---

## **1. Kubernetes Access Control (Azure RBAC + Kubernetes RBAC)**  

### **Step 1: Define Azure RBAC for AKS Access**
Run these Azure CLI commands to restrict who can **deploy/manage vs. view** AKS resources:  

```sh
# Assign "Azure Kubernetes Service RBAC Admin" to DevOps engineers (deployment access)
az role assignment create --assignee <devops-user-or-group-id> \
    --role "Azure Kubernetes Service RBAC Admin" \
    --scope /subscriptions/<SUB_ID>/resourceGroups/<RESOURCE_GROUP>/providers/Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/<AKS_CLUSTER>

# Assign "Azure Kubernetes Service Viewer" to general team members (view only)
az role assignment create --assignee <viewer-user-or-group-id> \
    --role "Azure Kubernetes Service Viewer" \
    --scope /subscriptions/<SUB_ID>/resourceGroups/<RESOURCE_GROUP>/providers/Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/<AKS_CLUSTER>
```

### **Step 2: Apply Kubernetes RBAC (Inside Cluster)**
Create a **Role** and a **RoleBinding** inside Kubernetes:  

```yaml
# Role: Allow only read access (for monitoring users)
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: default
  name: read-only-role
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods", "services"]
  verbs: ["get", "list"]

---
# RoleBinding: Assign Read-Only Access to Users
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: read-only-binding
  namespace: default
subjects:
- kind: Group
  name: monitoring-team   # This should match Entra ID Group Name
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: read-only-role
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

---

## **2. API Management (APIM) for External Teams**

### **Step 1: Define APIM Policy to Restrict Access by Subscription**
Apply an APIM policy to allow **only specific teams** to access APIs.  

```xml
<inbound>
    <base />
    <validate-jwt header-name="Authorization" require-scheme="Bearer">
        <openid-config url="https://login.microsoftonline.com/<TENANT_ID>/v2.0/.well-known/openid-configuration" />
        <required-claims>
            <claim name="roles">
                <value>api-access-team</value>
            </claim>
        </required-claims>
    </validate-jwt>
</inbound>
```

---

## **3. OIDC Authentication for Users (Frontend + API Security)**

### **Step 1: Register UI and API in Microsoft Entra ID**
1. **Create App Registrations:**
   - One for **Frontend UI** (`ui-client-id`)
   - One for **API Backend** (`api-client-id`)

2. **Expose API & Define Roles:**
   - In the **API App Registration**, go to **Expose an API** → **Add Scope** (e.g., `api.read`)
   - Under **App roles**, define:  
     - `User`: Can call APIs  
     - `Admin`: Can manage services  

3. **Assign Users to Roles:**  
   - Go to **Entra ID → Enterprise Applications → Your API App**
   - Assign users to `User` or `Admin` roles  

---

### **Step 2: Implement OIDC Authentication in API**
For a **Spring Boot Backend**:

1. **Add Dependencies (`pom.xml`)**
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-oauth2-resource-server</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

2. **Configure Security (`application.yml`)**
```yaml
spring:
  security:
    oauth2:
      resourceserver:
        jwt:
          issuer-uri: https://login.microsoftonline.com/<TENANT_ID>/v2.0
          audiences: api://<api-client-id>
```

3. **Secure API Endpoints (`SecurityConfig.java`)**
```java
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfig {
    @Bean
    public SecurityFilterChain securityFilterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
            .authorizeHttpRequests(auth -> auth
                .requestMatchers("/admin/**").hasRole("Admin") // Only Admins
                .requestMatchers("/user/**").hasRole("User")   // Only Users
                .anyRequest().authenticated()
            )
            .oauth2ResourceServer(OAuth2ResourceServerConfigurer::jwt);
        return http.build();
    }
}
```

---

### **Step 3: Authenticate Users in Frontend (React using MSAL)**
```javascript
import { PublicClientApplication } from "@azure/msal-browser";

const msalInstance = new PublicClientApplication({
    auth: {
        clientId: "ui-client-id",
        authority: "https://login.microsoftonline.com/<TENANT_ID>",
        redirectUri: "http://localhost:3000"
    }
});

export default msalInstance;
```

**Get Access Token & Call API:**
```javascript
const request = {
    scopes: ["api://<api-client-id>/api.read"]
};

msalInstance.acquireTokenSilent(request).then(response => {
    fetch("https://your-api.com/user/data", {
        headers: {
            "Authorization": `Bearer ${response.accessToken}`
        }
    }).then(res => res.json())
    .then(data => console.log(data));
});
```

---

### **4. Role Management & User Creation**
1. **Create Users in Entra ID**
   - Go to **Entra ID → Users → New User**
   - Assign them to a **Group** (e.g., `api-access-team`)

2. **Assign Roles to Users**
   - Under **API App Registration** → **Enterprise Applications**  
   - Assign `User` or `Admin` role to users.

---

## **Summary of Configurations**
| Component        | Security Mechanism |
|-----------------|------------------|
| **Kubernetes** | Azure RBAC for cluster access + Kubernetes RBAC for namespace control |
| **APIM** | JWT validation to restrict access by role (`api-access-team`) |
| **API Security** | OIDC (Microsoft Entra ID) with role-based access control |
| **Frontend (UI)** | MSAL.js for authentication, OAuth2 flow |

---

Would you like a **Terraform/Bicep script** to automate this setup? 🚀

To integrate **Kubernetes** with **Microsoft Entra ID, APIM, and OIDC authentication**, follow these steps:  

---

# **1. Kubernetes Access Control**
## **Step 1: Enable Azure AD Authentication in AKS**
When creating an AKS cluster, enable **Microsoft Entra ID** integration:

```sh
az aks update \
  --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> \
  --name <AKS_CLUSTER> \
  --enable-aad
```

If creating a new AKS cluster:

```sh
az aks create \
  --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> \
  --name <AKS_CLUSTER> \
  --enable-aad \
  --aad-admin-group-object-ids <AAD_ADMIN_GROUP_ID>
```

🔹 **Admin Group**: `<AAD_ADMIN_GROUP_ID>` should be the Object ID of the **team that manages Kubernetes deployments**.

---

## **Step 2: Assign Kubernetes RBAC Roles**
To ensure **DevOps can deploy** and **others can only view**, define roles in Kubernetes.

### **🔹 DevOps Access (Full Management)**
```sh
kubectl create clusterrolebinding devops-admin-binding \
  --clusterrole=cluster-admin \
  --user=<devops-user-email>
```

### **🔹 Read-Only Access (For Observability Team)**
Create a **Role** and a **RoleBinding**:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: default
  name: read-only-role
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods", "services"]
  verbs: ["get", "list"]
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: read-only-binding
  namespace: default
subjects:
- kind: Group
  name: monitoring-team  # Microsoft Entra ID Group
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: read-only-role
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

🔹 Replace `"monitoring-team"` with the **Microsoft Entra Group ID** that contains the read-only users.

---

# **2. API Management (APIM) Configuration**
## **Step 1: Secure API Access with Entra ID**
Add this **policy** in Azure API Management (APIM) to **allow only users with the right role**:

```xml
<inbound>
    <validate-jwt header-name="Authorization" require-scheme="Bearer">
        <openid-config url="https://login.microsoftonline.com/<TENANT_ID>/v2.0/.well-known/openid-configuration" />
        <required-claims>
            <claim name="roles">
                <value>api-access-team</value>
            </claim>
        </required-claims>
    </validate-jwt>
</inbound>
```

🔹 This ensures only users assigned the **api-access-team role** can call the APIs.

---

# **3. Secure API Access for UI using OIDC**
### **Step 1: Enable OIDC in Kubernetes Ingress**
If using **NGINX Ingress**, add OIDC authentication:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: my-ingress
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-url: "https://login.microsoftonline.com/<TENANT_ID>/oauth2/v2.0/authorize"
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-signin: "https://your-ui-app.com/login"
spec:
  rules:
  - host: api.yourdomain.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /user
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: user-service
            port:
              number: 80
```

🔹 **This forces authentication before accessing APIs.**

---

### **Step 2: Deploy a Kubernetes API with OIDC Authentication**
If your **API is in Kubernetes**, enforce **OIDC authentication**:

#### **🔹 Deployment YAML**
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: api-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: api
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: api
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: api
        image: my-api:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
        env:
        - name: OAUTH_ISSUER_URI
          value: "https://login.microsoftonline.com/<TENANT_ID>/v2.0"
        - name: OAUTH_AUDIENCE
          value: "api://<api-client-id>"
```

🔹 This **injects** OIDC authentication details into the API.

---

### **Step 3: Authenticate in UI and Pass Token to API**
Your frontend (React/Angular) should **fetch a token** and send it with API requests:

```javascript
const request = {
    scopes: ["api://<api-client-id>/api.read"]
};

msalInstance.acquireTokenSilent(request).then(response => {
    fetch("https://api.yourdomain.com/user", {
        headers: {
            "Authorization": `Bearer ${response.accessToken}`
        }
    }).then(res => res.json())
    .then(data => console.log(data));
});
```

---

# **4. Automate with Helm & Terraform**
To automate the Kubernetes and security setup, use **Helm & Terraform**.

## **🔹 Helm Chart for Secure API Deployment**
```yaml
apiVersion: v2
name: secure-api
version: 1.0.0
description: A secure API with Entra ID authentication
dependencies:
- name: ingress-nginx
  repository: https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx
  version: 4.2.5
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: {{ .Values.api.name }}
spec:
  replicas: {{ .Values.api.replicas }}
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: {{ .Values.api.name }}
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: {{ .Values.api.name }}
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: api
        image: "{{ .Values.api.image }}"
        env:
        - name: OAUTH_ISSUER_URI
          value: {{ .Values.oidc.issuer }}
        - name: OAUTH_AUDIENCE
          value: {{ .Values.oidc.audience }}
```

## **🔹 Terraform to Set AKS + APIM Security**
```hcl
resource "azurerm_kubernetes_cluster" "aks" {
  name                = "secure-aks"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.rg.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.rg.name
  enable_rbac         = true

  identity {
    type = "SystemAssigned"
  }

  role_based_access_control {
    enabled = true
    azure_active_directory {
      managed = true
      admin_group_object_ids = ["<AAD_ADMIN_GROUP_ID>"]
    }
  }
}

resource "azurerm_api_management" "apim" {
  name                = "secure-apim"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.rg.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.rg.name
  publisher_name      = "MyCompany"
  publisher_email     = "admin@mycompany.com"
}

resource "azurerm_api_management_api" "api" {
  name                = "secure-api"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.rg.name
  api_management_name = azurerm_api_management.apim.name
  revision           = "1"
  display_name       = "Secure API"
  path               = "secure-api"
  protocols          = ["https"]
}
```

---
